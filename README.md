# user-tester-manager
User Testing Manager is a tool that helps simplify the user testing management process.  Admin can add, manage, delete, and notify user testers about their testing sessions. It stores user tester's information such as their name, email, and contact number to send email reminders to user testers about the testing information such as time, date, and testing method. 


# Getting started
Python - 3.8 was used to compile and run the project. Feel free to download and use the latest version here https://www.python.org/downloads/
GitBash - used to clone my repo and code changes to your machine
Powershell (optional) - used to run scripts to execute your code. I used this but feel free to use any other way you're comfortable with.

# Running the App
Open Windows Powershell and go into the directory in which you cloned the repo.

Copy and paste the following command into your Powershell:

& "{path-to-your-user-directory}/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/python3.9.exe" {path-to-cloned-repo}/user-tester-manager/main.py

If working properly, you should see the screen below:
